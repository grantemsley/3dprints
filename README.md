# 3dprints

These are pre-sliced gcode files for things I've made with my Monoprice Maker Select.

This way I can come back and print them with the exact same settings easily.

knurling_nut - 1h 30m

rounded_knurling_nut - 1h 40m

### Rings

These are interlocking rings that can rotate in any direction

solid_rings_fidget - 4h 10m

### Spinner integrated bearings

These are fidget spinners with integrated bearings, so they are a single piece with no metal bearings needed.

The flat one has finger pads that are level with the body, not inset, so it prints better without as much overhang.  It's also at .2mm layer heights instead of 0.1mm awfor faster printing.
