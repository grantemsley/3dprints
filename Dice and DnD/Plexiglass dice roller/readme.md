# Plexiglass Dice Roller

This is a dice roller with plexiglass front and side.

Print body-left and body-right and glue together.  A peg sticks out of one into the other to give a solid gluing area.  Use a piece of the plexiglass to ensure proper alignment.

Print 3x glass-holder to cover the edges of the plexiglass.

The base takes 15 hours to print.
